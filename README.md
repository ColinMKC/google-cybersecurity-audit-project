# Internal Security Audit Project (Fictional Company)
Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate — Portfolio Project

## Overview
Demonstrates my ability to conduct an internal security audit, including a risk assessment analysis, controls evaluation, and compliance analysis. All company data is fictional and provided by the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

## Skills Demonstrated
* Internal security auditing
* Risk assessment analysis
* Controls assessment
* Controls categorization (administrative, technical, physical)
* Documentation skills
* Report writing
* Security governance fundamentals

## Project Components
Scope, Goals, and Risk Assement Report
Control Categories
Controls & Compliance Checklist

## Summary of Findings
To begin, the implementation of stricter access controls based on least privilege and separation of duties is necessary, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive data such as credit card information and PII/SPII on a need-to-know basis. Additionally, encryption of customers’ credit card information is required to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive information. Furthermore, the installation of an Intrusion Detection System will help detect and prevent traffic that matches threat-related signatures. In addition, creating disaster recovery plans and backing up critical data is essential to ensure business continuity. Stronger password complexity requirements, along with a centralized password management system, should also be employed. Finally, it is recommended to upgrade legacy systems whenever possible, or otherwise implement a strict schedule to regularly monitor and maintain these systems.

## What I Learned
* How to apply structured audit methodologies
* How to evaluate risk using impact/likelihood matrices
* How to assess controls using industry best practices
* How compliance frameworks influence audit decisions
